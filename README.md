# Dominant Social Media Advertising Colors

The performance of social media ads is not only about targeting but also about ad design. The design of the ad is a main performance factor color, but the colors also have an effect. Some types of audience can be attracted to certain colors, and this is what is covered.

This repository contains a python solution that extracts the top 3 dominant colors per image and visualizes them. It can also process multiple images and join the results together in an image for designer reference. The number 3 was chosen to cover the main 2 design colors and the text color when possible.

An example for single image input:
